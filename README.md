# Shared contact lists with Origon

With Origon's shared contact lists, everybody keeps their own contact information up to date. Whenever one of your contacts updates their address, email or phone number, you will have their updated information at your fingertips the next time you open Origon. This way, the contact lists always stay up to date.

With Origon you can create new shared contact lists and join existing ones. You own and maintain your own contact information, and you and your contacts collectively own and maintain the information for contacts who are not yet using Origon.

A shared contact list is typically associated with a group of people you already interact with in your daily life, such as school classes, sports teams, local communities and shared interest groups.

Use Origon to:

* Connect with your peers at work, in your sports team and local community.
* Connect with the parents of your children’s classmates, teammates and friends.
* Connect with your children’s teachers and sports coaches.
* Send group texts or emails to all or select contacts in a list.
* Get instant directions to a contact’s home address.
* Assign per list contact responsibilities.
* ... and much more.
